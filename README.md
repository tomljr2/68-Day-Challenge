# 68 Day Challenge
I was accepted for a software development internship at NASA with the Command and Control System at Kennedy Space Center.
The goal of this challenge is to take the skills necessary for the internship and to improve on them by writing increasingly difficult 
small programs in the languages and frameworks that are used. Ideally, this will have me well prepared to make a positive impact
for the internship and possibly my future at NASA.

## Skills to improve
* Java
* C++
* JUnit
* Bash
* Jenkins
* Robot framework
* Powermock
* Mockito
* Python
